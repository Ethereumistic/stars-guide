I am building a web application called "stars.guide" that will help users learn about stars and constellations, get personalized horoscopes, and more.  

Your task is to build an incredible 'learn' page for this app. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your desing capabilities. In the learn page there will be different sections/cards/categories of things to learn about like zodiac signs, houses etc. I need you to currently focus on the /learn page and the /learn/signs page, which should contain all 12 zodiac signs. Currently we have a working /learn page and /learn/signs page, but they are very basic. I want you to completely redo them from scratch at /learn2/signs and also include /learn2/signs/[sign] for each having a unique page. The only things you are allowed to copy from the existing page is the colors and icons nothing else!

Currently we have base zodiac information at \src\utils\zodiac.ts and I want you to use that information to create the zodiac signs visual elements and base information.

Do NOT use any external libraries. Only use the libraries that are already installed in the project. Do not add any new dependencies, and do NOT use any MCP servers.

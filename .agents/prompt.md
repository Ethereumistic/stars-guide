Lets refine these: 
Elemental pathway:
Currently I am a big fan of the formulas for the elemental pathways but you are
'shooting' random trendy catch phrases referring to people today and stuff regarding them,
this is something unacceptable that we cannot do in stars.guide. Instead of writing in volatile times you bought bitcoin at 100$ .... write something that EVERYONE will relate to, yes EVERYONE even a person with another sign or a total astrology sceptic, or a flat earther or the biggest fan of astrology!

Output ONLY the fully rewritten Elemental Pathways section in the same grouped format. No introductions, no explanations, no additional commentary — just the clean, fixed content ready for stars.guide.

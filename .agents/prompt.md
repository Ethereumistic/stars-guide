I am building a web application called "stars.guide" that will help users learn about stars and constellations, get personalized horoscopes, and more.  

Your task is to build an incredible marketing homepage for this app. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your desing capabilities.

Currently we have that C:\Users\badja\Documents\Projects_Developement\stars.guide\stars-guide\src\components\hero
hero folder, with the current hero component.

Once analyzed and observed I want you to create FIVE different designs. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted at /1, /2, /3, /4, /5.

Do NOT use any external libraries. Only use the libraries that are already installed in the project. Do not add any new dependencies, and do NOT use any MCP servers.
